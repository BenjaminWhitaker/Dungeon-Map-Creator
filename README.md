# Dungeon-Map-Creator
This procedural map generator algorithm creates a set of rooms connected by hallways, arranged in a tile-based format. Each run generates a new map with varying room sizes, and layout, creating a dynamic exploration experience for the player.

The key objectives of this project are:

Random Map Layouts: To provide a different game experience on each playthrough.
Replayability: By creating varied maps, this system increases the replayability of a game.
Efficient Map Generation: The algorithm is designed to generate complex maps in real-time without significant delays.
Features
Random Room Generation: The number, size, and location of rooms vary each time the generator is run.
Interconnected Rooms: Rooms are linked by hallways, ensuring the entire map is accessible while maintaining an organic, non-grid-like structure.
Flexible Tile Types: Tiles can represent different kinds of terrain, such as walls, floors, obstacles, and doors.
Adjustable Parameters: The number of rooms, minimum and maximum room size, and other parameters are fully configurable.
